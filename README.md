# dpll
Brief implementation of the [DPLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm) 3SAT solver.
Based on [DPLL Method [PDF]](http://profs.sci.univr.it/~farinelli/courses/ar/slides/DPLL.pdf).
Unit clause and pure literal elimination is implemented, but downgrading to a linear algorithm
if presented a 2SAT problem isn't.
